### Custom Theme inspired by Tron: Legacy

Apart from 'the Emacs scene' in the 2010 Tron film, the colorscheme is
heavily inspired by Base16-Black-Metal, Doom, Grayscale and City Lights.


## Invoking theme:

Simply put this file in "~/.emacs.d/themes/"

Then add these 2 lines in you init file:

    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
    (load-theme `tron t)

You're good to go!
